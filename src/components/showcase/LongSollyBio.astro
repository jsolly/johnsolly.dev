                As a highly skilled geospatial software engineer, I have a
                wealth of experience blending GIS domain knowledge with
                full-stack development to create stunning and efficient mapping
                applications. My academic background includes a bachelor's
                degree in Geography from UCSB, where I had the privilege of
                studying under renowned thought leaders Michael Goodchild and
                Waldo Tobler. I further honed my skills with an M.S. in
                Geoinformatics and Geospatial Intelligence at George Mason
                University. After graduation, I played a pivotal role in
                launching one of the world's most viewed geospatial web
                applications, <a

            <p>
                After Esri, I spent a year as an Integration Consultant at a
                business intelligence startup called YellowfinBI which was
                aquired by Idera Inc. in 2022. I left Yellowfin after the
                aquisition to work on this blog while also rasing my son,
                Justice Solly, who was born 2/20/22. Six months later, I joined
                University of Maryland as a senior geospatial developer for the <a

                    >Filecoin Foundation For the Decentralied Web</a
                >. I was responsible for developing infrastructure that enables
                efficient, accessible, and sustainable onloading, analysis, and
                extraction of large geospatial datasets into blockchain-managed
                decentralized storage systems such as Filecoin and IPFS.
